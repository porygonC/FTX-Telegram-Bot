# FTX-Telegram-Bot
Bot for sending telegram messages on order fills on cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

TODO:

I have to deal with when orders are filled in 2 parts.
Maybe store the current fill and after 1s or smth send the message.
    Better alternative: Just use the rest position endpoint.

Also, fix that risk/reward thing it's getting all messed up.

I have to test if it runs for over 24h
